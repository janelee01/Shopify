            <h2>Our Priorities</h2>
              <p>At our core, we’re a company that wants to see our customers out in the world: exploring, connecting, working, and discovering. And while we obsess over the design and functionality of our products, we’re equally concerned with our larger impact as a business. </p>
              <p>For us, it’s not enough to “do no harm” when it comes to environmental impact. We are part of a growing movement that believes businesses can actually lead the way in reversing environmental damage and creating innovative solutions. We’re always seeking ways to improve our supply chain and the lifecycle of our products. </p>
              <p>We also know that you, our customers, are conscientious and uncompromising, and you expect the same from the brands you support. As a business, we’re in it for the long run—and to us, that means honoring our planet and the people with whom we share it.</p>

          <h2>Our Challenges</h2>
          <p>Prioritizing sustainability can be complicated and costly. As a small, family-owned business, we know that our commitment to sustainability means that we will sometimes sacrifice opportunities or revenue in order to be responsible, and we’re proud to do that. Today, our primary challenges are:</p>

            <h3 class="title">We can’t do it all—at least not right now.</h3>
            <p>While we expand our sustainable practices, we know it will take time to integrate sustainability into all elements of our business—from our supply chain to our in-office operations. As a small business, we need to prioritize rigorously. To do so, we’ve created an internal sustainability board that ensures we’re progressing and pushing ourselves to be ambitious. For example, we are working towards becoming a B Certified business (B Corp), which would mean we’ve met “the highest standards of verified environmental performance, public transparency, and legal accountability.”</p>

          <div class="topic-content">
            <h3 class="title">Tradeoffs are inevitable.</h3>
            <p>Materials like “vegan leather” are great for those looking to avoid animal products, but they’re not harmless.  Many vegan leathers (specifically PVC) are a form of plastic; therefore, they aren’t biodegradable and they can contain harmful chemicals that damage the environment. For now, we’ve opted to use traditional leather over vegan leather, but we continue to research emerging resources that offer a promise of sustainability, are non-toxic, and allow us to uphold the high standard of quality that defines our products. Internally, we have to weigh this kind of tension when choosing materials, and we always prioritize with our customers’ best interests in mind.</p>
