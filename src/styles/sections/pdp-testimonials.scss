/**
 * Even though we use Post CSS and BEM as documented in our
 * best practices, we are going to use SASS with -VERY- minimal
 * nesting for this project so it feels inline with the rest of the
 * site code to some degree.
 *
 * Please only use one level of nesting where possible
 * Avoid the use of !important
 * Couple media queries inside the declaration in which it relates to 
 * Use existing color variables (see /local)
 * Declare all type styles in a new variables sheet for use in PDP only
 * Review and use existing media queries where possible
